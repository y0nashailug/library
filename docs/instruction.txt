INSTRUCTIONS
============
The Library System starts from a separate login page.

There is a folder/package in src called librarysystem which contains
a start-up code of the system and the Main class is the starting point of the application.

But we need to run the test data first as new data has been added to support the new
requirements.

So the steps will be as follows

1. Run the test data in the DAO
2. Run the Main java class in the librarysystem package

Login screen will show up and need to type username and password.

Librarian role
	username: 101 password: xyz
Admin
	username: 102 password: abc
Both
	username: 103 password: 111

After successful login we will be able to see screen based on the role.
